"""THE EXTERN WALL'S WIDTH KEEPER.

Avra's `int` is 64 bits; C's `int` is 32. An `extern fn f() -> int`
is declared `i64` at the seam (language/llvm.av's `declare_externs`),
but a C body answering a narrow type writes only the low half — and
neither ABI promises the bits above it. Both compilers materialise a
32-bit result with a 32-bit write, which ZEROES the upper half, so a
negative C `int` reads as a large positive Avra `int`.

MEASURED (2026-09-05): a C `int` returning -1 reads as 4294967295,
INT_MIN reads as 2147483648, and `f() == 0 - 1` answers false. BOTH
ENGINES AGREE on the wrong answer, so `eval == native` cannot catch
it — that property is AGREEMENT, never correctness.

THE SIZED TYPES HAVE LANDED. A seat may now name the machine width
its C prototype uses (`i32`, `u32`, `i64`), and the value crossing is
still an Avra `int` — A WIDTH IS A PROPERTY OF A SEAT, NOT OF A
VALUE. So the rule is no longer "every C body must be wide": it is
that the DECLARATION and the BODY must agree.

  declared `int` / `i64`  ->  a C return that fills the register
  declared `i32`          ->  a 32-bit SIGNED C type
  declared `u32`          ->  a 32-bit UNSIGNED C type
  declared `ptr`/`string` ->  a pointer

AND THE SOURCE LIST IS THE MANIFEST'S, NOT THIS SCRIPT'S. The old
limit — "it cannot see a THIRD party's headers" — was never about
third parties; it was about C that lives OUTSIDE THE TREE. VENDORED
C is in the tree, so a package that vendors an amalgamation gets the
same declaration-level check its own runtime gets, and the keeper
covers a wall it did not write. The list follows the package that
owns the C.

IT IS DECLARATION-LEVEL AND CALLS NOTHING, on purpose. A behavioural
checker gives a FALSE GREEN here: this libc's `atoi` is
`(int)strtol(...)`, so it answers -1 correctly through a narrow
extern, while a hand-written `int f(void){return -1;}` at -O2 answers
4294967295 — same prototype, opposite answers. The defect is
callee-dependent and invisible to any test that runs the callee it
happens to have. Only the declaration can be held to account.

    compiler warns "`sources` is not a key of `[link]`" at anything

    green waiting to happen. So the rule is the honest one available
    today: a package that links native code owns the C beside it, and
    a vendored amalgamation checked into that package is checked like
    any other body we can read. When a package can declare its own
    native build (ROADMAP: B7), prefer the key it registers and let
    this fall back.
